# Lyrics Always: Lyrics for Spotify

## Intro
Hi! I hope you're having a good day. I don't know about you, but I really like to
sing the words to songs that I like. Nailing all of the words to Kendrick Lamar's "m.A.A.d city"
perfectly in sync with him is a great feeling. I also play a lot of Hearthstone, a virtual card game
that involves taking turns. Half of the time that you're playing, however, it's your opponent's turn, leaving you
with nothing to do (strategically, you should being paying attention to what your opponent is doing, but it's a pretty passive
75 seconds). I want to learn the words to a lot of songs, and I figure that my opponent's turn in Hearthstone
is a great time to do that. That's why I created Lyrics Always.

## What does Lyrics Always do?
Lyrics Always brings up a little overlay, displaying the lyrics to the song currently playing on your Spotify account, in addition
to the song's name and artist. The button underneath the lyrics updates the lyrics to match the song that is currently playing.
That's all there is to it.

### Credit Where Credit is Due
Interacting with the Spotify API is done partly with [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy).

## Usage
Right now, it'll take a bit of setup for you to use Lyrics Always. You need Spotify API information and Genius API information, which I haven't figured out how to build safely into
the app yet without revealing anything sensitive.
Once I have this figured out, I'll update this section to include instructions.
